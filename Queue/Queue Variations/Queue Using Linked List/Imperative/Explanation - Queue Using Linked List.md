This code represents a circular queue implementation using a linked list with a free list. It manages nodes efficiently using a custom data structure, Node, which stores the data and a pointer to the next node. The circular queue is maintained using two pointers, QueueFront and QueueRear. The FreeListHead pointer is used to track the head of the free list.

The implementation includes the following procedures and functions:
1. InitializeNodes(): This procedure initializes the NodeList array and sets up the initial free list.

2. Enqueue(Data: Integer): This procedure takes an integer as input and adds it to the rear of the circular queue. If the free list is empty (meaning the queue is full), it outputs an error message. If the queue is not full, it adds the data to a new node and updates the pointers accordingly.

3. Dequeue(): This function removes an element from the front of the circular queue and returns its value. If the queue is empty, it outputs an error message and returns -1. If the queue has elements, it removes the front element, updates the pointers, and adds the removed node back to the free list.

4. Display(): This procedure displays the elements of the circular queue, along with the front, rear, and free pointers, and the size of the queue.

The main loop outside the procedures allows users to interact with the queue through a menu. The menu provides options to enqueue, dequeue, display the queue, or exit the program. Users input their choice, and the program calls the appropriate procedure or function based on the choice.
