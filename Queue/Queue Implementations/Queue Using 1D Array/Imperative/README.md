Imagine you have a line of toy cars. You want to make sure that whenever you add a new car, it goes to the back of the line, and when you remove a car, you take it from the front of the line. This is called a queue, just like when we stand in line for ice cream.

In this code, we have a line of numbers, called "queue," which can hold up to 10 numbers. We also have two pointers, "front" and "rear," which tell us where the front and back of the line are.

We can do three main things with our queue:

Add a number to the back of the line (called "enqueue").
Remove a number from the front of the line (called "dequeue").
Look at all the numbers in the line (called "display").
When we add a number to the back, we check if there's room for it. If there is, we put it at the back and move the "rear" pointer to show the new back of the line.

When we remove a number from the front, we check if there are any numbers in the line. If there are, we take the number at the front and move the "front" pointer to show the new front of the line.

When we want to look at all the numbers, we start at the front and move along the line until we reach the rear. We can also see how many numbers are in the line and where the front and rear pointers are.

The "main menu" helps us choose what we want to do with our queue. It asks us if we want to add a number, remove a number, look at the numbers, or stop playing with the queue. We can keep choosing options until we decide to stop.

So, this code is like a game where we manage a line of numbers, just like how we manage a line of toy cars or stand in line for ice cream.

So, this code is a simple implementation of a circular queue data structure using an array. A circular queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that treats the array as a circular buffer, allowing the efficient use of array space when enqueueing and dequeueing elements.

The queue is represented by an array "queue" with a fixed size of 10 elements, and two pointers "front" and "rear" to track the front and rear positions within the array. Both pointers are initialized to -1, indicating an empty queue.

The code provides three main operations for the queue:

Enqueue: This operation adds an element to the rear of the queue. It first checks if the queue is full by comparing the next position of the "rear" pointer with the "front" pointer. If the queue is full, it displays an error message. If the queue is empty, both "front" and "rear" pointers are set to 0, and the element is added at the rear. If the queue is not empty, the "rear" pointer is incremented in a circular fashion, and the element is added at the updated rear position.

Dequeue: This operation removes an element from the front of the queue. It first checks if the queue is empty and returns -1 if true. If the queue has only one element, the front and rear pointers are reset to -1, and the element is returned. If the queue has more than one element, the "front" pointer is incremented in a circular fashion, and the element at the old front position is returned.

Display: This operation displays the elements in the queue, the positions of the "front" and "rear" pointers, and the current size of the queue. It iterates through the elements from the front to the rear, printing them in order. The size of the queue is calculated based on the positions of the "front" and "rear" pointers.

The main menu drives the user's interaction with the queue, providing options to enqueue, dequeue, display, and exit the program. It reads the user's input and executes the corresponding operation based on their choice.

Overall, this implementation showcases a simple and efficient way to manage a circular queue data structure, allowing programmers to perform basic queue operations with minimal overhead.
