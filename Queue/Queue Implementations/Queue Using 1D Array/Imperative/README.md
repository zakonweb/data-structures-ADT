# Queue Data Structure Explanation

Imagine a line of toy cars. When adding a new car, it goes to the back of the line, and when removing a car, it's taken from the front of the line. This is a **queue**, just like standing in line for ice cream.

In the given code, there's a line of numbers, referred to as the "queue," which can hold up to 10 numbers. There are also two pointers, "front" and "rear," that indicate the front and back of the line, respectively.

Three main operations can be performed on the queue:

1. **Enqueue:** Add a number to the back of the line.
2. **Dequeue:** Remove a number from the front of the line.
3. **Display:** Look at all the numbers in the line.

When **enqueueing**, the code checks if there's room for a new number. If there is, the number is placed at the back, and the "rear" pointer is updated to show the new back of the line.

When **dequeuing**, the code checks if there are any numbers in the line. If there are, the number at the front is removed, and the "front" pointer is updated to show the new front of the line.

When **displaying**, the code starts at the front and moves along the line until it reaches the rear. It can also display the number of items in the line and the positions of the front and rear pointers.

The "main menu" allows interaction with the queue. It provides options to enqueue a number, dequeue a number, display the numbers, or stop interacting with the queue. The interaction continues until the user decides to stop.

This code serves as a simple implementation of a circular queue data structure using an array. A circular queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that treats the array as a circular buffer, enabling efficient usage of array space when enqueueing and dequeuing elements.

The queue is represented by an array "queue" with a fixed size of 10 elements, and two pointers "front" and "rear" to track the front and rear positions within the array. Both pointers are initialized to -1, indicating an empty queue.

The code provides three main operations for the queue:

**Enqueue:** This operation adds an element to the rear of the queue. It first checks if the queue is full by comparing the next position of the "rear" pointer with the "front" pointer. If the queue is full, it displays an error message. If the queue is empty, both "front" and "rear" pointers are set to 0, and the element is added at the rear. If the queue is not empty, the "rear" pointer is incremented in a circular fashion, and the element is added at the updated rear position.

**Dequeue:** This operation removes an element from the front of the queue. It first checks if the queue is empty and returns -1 if true. If the queue has only one element, the front and rear pointers are reset to -1, and the element is returned. If the queue has more than one element, the "front" pointer is incremented in a circular fashion, and the element at the old front position is returned.

**Display:** This operation displays the elements in the queue, the positions of the "front" and "rear" pointers, and the current size of the queue. It iterates through the elements from the front to the rear, printing them in order. The size of the queue is calculated based on the positions of the "front" and "rear" pointers.

The main menu drives the user's interaction with the queue, providing options to enqueue, dequeue, display, and exit
the program. It reads the user's input and executes the corresponding operation based on their choice.

In summary, this implementation showcases a simple and efficient way to manage a circular queue data structure. It allows programmers to perform basic queue operations with minimal overhead. This code is like a game where we manage a line of numbers, much like how we manage a line of toy cars or stand in line for ice cream.
