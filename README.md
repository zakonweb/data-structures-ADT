# AS and A2 Data structures
You can think of an ADT (Abstract Data Type) as collection of operations (i.e. add, remove, insert that define how the ADT behaves on a collection of data elements). At the ADT level, the exact way that the data is stored is hidden; hence the Abstract in Abstract Data Type. The big idea here is to hide the way data is presented to make it more accessible to others. Examples include Stack, Queue, Hash Tables and Binary Tree etc.

A data structure, on the other hand, actually implements those operations that define the ADT's behaviour. Examples include Array and List, using that ADT operations are implemented.
