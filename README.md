# data-structures-ADT-A2
The Abstract Data Types (ADTs) Repository, curated by Zafar Ali Khan, is a powerful educational resource designed to help learners, educators, and developers of all levels deepen their understanding of ADTs. The repository covers a wide range of ADT operations, providing practical examples and detailed explanations in Pseudocode, VB.NET, Java, and Python. The materials cover essential concepts such as stacks, queues, linked lists, dictionaries, binary trees, and hash tables. With a focus on both Object-Oriented and Imperative Programming paradigms, the repository is a versatile tool to enhance your programming knowledge and skills.

# Abstract Data Types (ADTs) Repository by Zafar Ali Khan

Welcome to the **Abstract Data Types (ADTs)** repository, curated by Zafar Ali Khan. This comprehensive and impactful resource is designed to help you master Abstract Data Types by providing implementations in Pseudocode, VB.NET, Java, and Python for all variations of each ADT. The repository is meticulously organized according to the ADT and its variations, and each variation contains source code and detailed explanations to facilitate your learning journey. Rest assured that all variations of each ADT have been covered in this repository.

## Syllabus Coverage: Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

This repository covers the following aspects of Abstract Data Types:

1. Understanding and using Abstract Data Types (ADTs)
2. Writing algorithms for finding an item in a linked list and binary tree
3. Writing algorithms for inserting an item into a stack, queue, linked list, and binary tree
4. Writing algorithms for deleting an item from a stack, queue, and linked list
5. Demonstrating how it is possible for ADTs to be implemented from another ADT
6. Describing the following ADTs and demonstrating how they can be implemented from appropriate built-in types or other ADTs: stack, queue, linked list, dictionary, and binary tree

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `ADT Operations.png`: A visual representation of ADT operations
- `ADT Operations.txt`: A textual description of ADT operations
- `Binary Tree/`: Contains implementations and explanations for binary tree ADT variations
- `HASH TABLES/`: Contains implementations and explanations for hash table ADT variations
- `Linked List/`: Contains implementations and explanations for linked list ADT variations
- `QUEUES/`: Contains implementations and explanations for queue ADT variations
- `Stack/`: Contains implementations and explanations for stack ADT variations
