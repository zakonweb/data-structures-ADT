The code is an example of a hash table that allows a user to insert a record key and search for a record key in the hash table. Here's a more detailed explanation:

The main program starts by creating an array called hashTable with 10 elements. Then, it prompts the user to enter 10 record keys by iterating through a For loop. The loop reads the record key from the user and inserts it into the hash table using the InsertHash subroutine. The InsertHash subroutine calculates the index of the key using the HashFunction function and inserts the key into the hash table at that index. If the index is already occupied, the subroutine finds the next available index.

After inserting the keys, the main program prompts the user to enter a search record key. It then searches for the key in the hash table using the SearchHash function, which also calculates the index of the key using the HashFunction function. If the key is found, the function returns the index of the key. Otherwise, it returns -1.

Finally, the main program outputs whether the key is found or not and the contents of the hash table using another For loop.
