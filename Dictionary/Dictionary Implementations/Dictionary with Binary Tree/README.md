# Binary Tree Implementation as Dictionary in Python, Java, and VB.NET

### NB: For CAIE AL preparation `Dictionary with BT` should not be considered.

## Python

Python has no built-in binary tree data type, but it can be implemented using a user-defined class.

- **Node Class**: This class represents each node in the tree. Each node has a key, value, left child, and right child.

- **BinaryTreeDict Class**: This class represents the binary tree itself. It has a root property and methods to insert and search nodes.

- **Insert Method**: This method inserts a node into the binary tree. If the key already exists, it updates the value.

- **Search Method**: This method searches for a node in the binary tree using a given key.

## Java

Java has no built-in binary tree data type, but it can be implemented using a user-defined class.

- **Node Class**: This class represents each node in the tree. Each node has a key, value, left child, and right child.

- **BinaryTree Class**: This class represents the binary tree itself. It has a root property and methods to insert and search nodes.

- **Insert Method**: This method inserts a node into the binary tree. If the key already exists, it updates the value.

- **Search Method**: This method searches for a node in the binary tree using a given key.

## VB.NET

VB.NET has no built-in binary tree data type, but it can be implemented using a user-defined class.

- **Node Class**: This class represents each node in the tree. Each node has a key, value, left child, and right child.

- **BinaryTree Class**: This class represents the binary tree itself. It has a root property and methods to insert and search nodes.

- **Insert Method**: This method inserts a node into the binary tree. If the key already exists, it updates the value.

- **Search Method**: This method searches for a node in the binary tree using a given key.
