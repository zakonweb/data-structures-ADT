# Hash Table Implementation in Python, Java, and VB.NET

## Python

Python has a built-in data type called `dict` which can be used to create a key-value pair, similar to the Hash Table data structure.

- **Dictionary Class**: This class is defined with a constructor that initializes an empty dictionary. This class contains four methods: `insert`, `delete`, `search`, and `display`.

- **Insert Method**: This method is used to insert a key-value pair into the dictionary.

- **Delete Method**: This method is used to delete a key-value pair from the dictionary. If the key does not exist, it prints an error message.

- **Search Method**: This method is used to search for a key in the dictionary and returns the corresponding value if the key exists. If the key does not exist, it returns an error message.

- **Display Method**: This method is used to display all the key-value pairs in the dictionary.

## Java

Java provides a built-in class `HashMap` in the `java.util` package, which implements the `Map` interface and allows us to store key-value pairs similar to a Hash Table.

- **Dictionary Class**: This class is defined with a constructor that initializes an empty HashMap. This class contains four methods: `insert`, `delete`, `search`, and `display`.

- **Insert Method**: This method is used to insert a key-value pair into the HashMap.

- **Delete Method**: This method is used to delete a key-value pair from the HashMap. If the key does not exist, it prints an error message.

- **Search Method**: This method is used to search for a key in the HashMap and returns the corresponding value if the key exists. If the key does not exist, it returns an error message.

- **Display Method**: This method is used to display all the key-value pairs in the HashMap.

## VB.NET

VB.NET provides a built-in class `Hashtable` in the `System.Collections` namespace, which can be used to create a key-value pair, similar to the Hash Table data structure.

- **Dictionary Module**: This module contains a Hashtable and has methods for inserting, deleting, searching, and displaying key-value pairs.

- **Insert Option**: This option is used to insert a key-value pair into the Hashtable.

- **Delete Option**: This option is used to delete a key-value pair from the Hashtable. If the key does not exist, it prints an error message.

- **Search Option**: This option is used to search for a key in the Hashtable and returns the corresponding value if the key exists. If the key does not exist, it returns an error message.

- **Display Option**: This option is used to display all the key-value pairs in the Hashtable.
