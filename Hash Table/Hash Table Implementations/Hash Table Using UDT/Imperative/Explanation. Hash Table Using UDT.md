The code is an implementation of a hash table data structure, which is a common data structure used in computer science to store key-value pairs in a way that allows for efficient insertion and retrieval of values directly.

The code begins by defining a RECORD user defined type (UDT) with two fields, key and value, that represent the key-value pairs that will be stored in the hash table. The HashFunction() function takes a key and a size parameter and returns an integer hash code based on the key value and the size of the hash table. 

The SearchHash() function takes a recordKey and a hashTable[] parameter and searches the hash table for a record with the given recordKey. It returns the index of the record in the hash table if found, or -1 if not found. 

The InsertHash() procedure takes a record and a hashTable[] parameter and inserts the record into the hash table using the hash function to determine the index at which to insert the record.

The MAIN code block prompts the user to enter 11 record keys and inserts them into the hash table using the InsertHash() procedure. It then prompts the user to enter a search key and searches the hash table for a record with that key using the SearchHash() function. If the record is found, the code prints the corresponding value; if not, it prints "Not Found". The code then prints out the values of all the records in the hash table using a FOR...NEXT loop, and waits for the user to press a key before exiting the program.
