# Detailed explanation of the code:

First, some constants are defined at the top of the code. The **NULL_POINTER** constant is used to represent a null pointer or empty node, while the **MAX_TREE_SIZE** constant sets the maximum size of the binary tree. These constants are used throughout the code to make it more readable and easier to modify.

## Binary Tree Declaration

Next, the binary tree is declared using three one-dimensional arrays: _Data_, _Left_, and _Right_. The _Data_ array stores the data of each node in the binary tree, while the _Left_ and _Right_ arrays store the pointers to the left and right child nodes respectively. The _Root_ variable is used to store the pointer to the root of the binary tree.

## InitializeTree Procedure

The **InitializeTree** procedure initializes the binary tree by setting the _Root_ pointer to **NULL_POINTER** and setting all the nodes in the _Data_, _Left_, and _Right_ arrays to **NULL_POINTER**.

## Main Program 

The main program then displays a menu of binary tree operations and waits for user input. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding operation is performed using the appropriate subroutine.

## InsertNode Procedure

The **InsertNode** procedure inserts a new node into the binary tree by finding an empty slot in the _Data_ array, storing the data item in the new node, and setting the left and right pointers to **NULL_POINTER**. If the binary tree is full, an error message is outputted. If the binary tree is not empty, the **InsertNode** procedure traverses the binary tree to find the insertion point for the new node. Starting at the _Root_ node, it compares the data item of each node in the binary tree with the data item of the new node. If the new data item is less than the current node's data, it goes to the left child node, otherwise it goes to the right child node. When it reaches a **NULL_POINTER**, it sets the appropriate pointer to insert the new node.

## IterativeSearch Function

The **IterativeSearch** function searches for a node iteratively in the binary tree by starting at the _Root_ node and following the left or right pointers depending on whether the search item is less than or greater than the current node's data. If the search item is found, the function returns the pointer to the node containing the item, otherwise it returns a **NULL_POINTER**.

## RecursiveSearch Function

The **RecursiveSearch** function searches for a node recursively in the binary tree by starting at the _Root_ node and recursively traversing the binary tree to find the insertion point for the new node. If the search item is found, the function returns the pointer to the node containing the item, otherwise it returns a **NULL_POINTER**.

## Tree Traversal Procedures

The **InOrderTraversal**, **PreOrderTraversal**, and **PostOrderTraversal** procedures perform in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals of the binary tree respectively. They all start at the _Root_ node and recursively traverse the binary tree in the specified order.

## ShowBinaryTreeArray Procedure

The **ShowBinaryTreeArray** procedure displays the contents of the binary tree by outputting the _Data_, _Left_, and _Right_ arrays in tabular form.

## VisualizeBinaryTreeWithEdges Procedure

The **VisualizeBinaryTreeWithEdges** procedure creates a 2D array to store the binary tree and its edges, and then calls the **VisualizeTree** procedure to populate the 2D array. It then calls the **PrintTree** procedure to output the binary tree with edges.

## VisualizeTree Procedure

The **VisualizeTree** procedure recursively traverses the binary tree and populates the 2D array with the nodes and their connections. It takes in the current node, the current level of the tree, and the position of the node in the 2D array as parameters.

## PrintTree Procedure

Finally, the **PrintTree** procedure outputs the binary tree with edges by iterating through the 2D array and outputting the nodes and their connections. It first initializes some variables to keep track of the current level and the start and end indices of each level. It then iterates through each index of the 2D array and outputs the node at that index. If the index is the start index of a new level, it outputs some spaces before outputting the node. If the index is the end index of the current level, it updates the start and end indices of the next level. It then outputs a new line to start a new level.

## Main Program Loop

The main program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit. It displays a menu of binary tree operations and waits for user input. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding operation is performed using the appropriate subroutine. For example, if the user chooses to insert a node, the **InsertNode** procedure is called. If the user chooses to search for a node iteratively, the **IterativeSearch** function is called. If the user chooses to visualize the binary tree with edges, the **VisualizeBinaryTreeWithEdges** procedure is called.

# Conclusion

Overall, this pseudocode implements a binary tree data structure using three 1D arrays and provides a menu of operations for the user to perform on the binary tree. The program allows the user to insert nodes, search for nodes, traverse the binary tree, display its contents, and visualize it with edges.
